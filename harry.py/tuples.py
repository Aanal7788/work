#creating a tuple using ()
t = (1, 2, 4, 5)
# t1 = () #empty tuple
t1 = (1)# wrong way to declare a tuple with single element
t1=(1,)#tuple with single element(must need to put coma)
print(t1)
# printing the elements of tuple
print(t[0])
# cannot update te values of a tuple
t[0]=34 #throws an error
